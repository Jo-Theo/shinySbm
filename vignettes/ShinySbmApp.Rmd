## Introduction

This vignette illustrates the use of the {shinySbm} package which is a shiny based graphical user interface (GUI) of the {sbm} package. These packages are made to apply **Stochastic Block Models** on network dataset. Whether it is an edges list or a matrix. We will first show how to use the shiny application. And then how to use the external functions as `plotSbm()` and `visSbm()`. 

###  The shiny appplication: `shinySbmApp()`

**shinySbm** package use {shiny} package to build an interface for the [{sbm}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sbm/index.html) package, on a html page. Users can import data from it and apply **Stochastic Block Models**. They can transform network data from **edges list** to **connection matrix**. Once the SBM ran, users can explore the different number of groups selected by {sbm}. They can get models outputs as: table of parameters, plots, interactive network visuals, automatic reports (pdf or html) (French or English), R script to repeat the analysis outside of the app and tables of block attributions. 

The following code show how to run `shinySbmApp()` from your R console.

```{r setup,eval=FALSE}
library(shinySbm)
shinySbmApp()
```

When this is done a your browser should open and load the opening page. From this page you can load your dataset by clicking on the **Browse** button in embedded in red.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shinysbmapp1.png")
```

When you load it, the install helper (**1**) can show indication to adjust the importation. For example here, we imported this set as an **Adjacency or Incidence matrix** but as we can see in (**2**), we imported an Edges list.  So, we need to change the **nature** of imported data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shinysbmapp2.png")
```

When there is no **warnings** any more, we can then press the button **Matrix Builder**, which will extract essential information from your dataset. If your used an **edges list**, an **adjacency matrix** will be built. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shinysbmapp3.png")
```

Once the matrix is correctly imported. You should go to the **SBM application** (**1**) page and then click on the **Run SBM** button (**2**). When the calculation are done you will see a small summary from the current model. The small module **Block settings** allows you by clicking on the graph (or numeric input) to select another block number and change the current model. You can also tune your SBM model from this page with the **More Settings** button. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shinysbmapp4.png")
```

Then it's time to explore the visuals and outputs in the other pages. 

###  External functions

The following codes are built by the `shinySbmApp` application, page **Report** with the **R code** option. The next chunk is made only from {sbm} package functions.

```{r}
# Loading Dataset 
myNetworkMatrix <- fungusTreeNetwork$fungus_tree

# Fiting SBM
mySbmModel <- estimateBipartiteSBM(netMat = myNetworkMatrix, model = 'bernoulli',
                                   estimOptions = list(plot = F, verbosity = 0))
```

See this vignette to learn more of {sbm}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("SBM_fungus_tree_network")
```

The function `plotSbm` is a convenient function that can take matrices or objects produced by `estimateBipartiteSBM()` and `estimateSimpleSBM()` of {sbm} as arguments. It plot them in a nice matrix of tiles, that can be ordered by blocks or not, transposed etc...

```{r, out.width="100%",fig.width = 12,fig.height = 5}
plotSbm(
  mySbmModel,
  ordered = TRUE,
  transpose = TRUE,
  labels = c(row = 'Fungus', col = 'Trees'),
  plotOptions = list(
    showLegend = FALSE,
    showPredictions = TRUE
  ))
```

The function `visSbm` is a convenient function that can take objects produced by `estimateBipartiteSBM()` and `estimateSimpleSBM()` of {sbm} as arguments (doesn't take matrices). It make a {visNetwork} type object that represent the network condensed by blocks. 

```{r, out.width="100%"}
visSbm(
  x = mySbmModel,
  labels = c(row = 'Fungus', col = 'Trees'),
  directed = TRUE,
  settings = list(
    edge_threshold = 'default',
    arrows = TRUE,
    arrow_start = 'row'
  ))
```
